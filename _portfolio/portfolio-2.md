## Morse Code LoRa Walkie-Talkie

An open-source long-range communication project that combines the classic art of Morse code with modern LoRa (Long Range) radio technology. Born during the COVID-19 lockdowns as a hobby project, this battery-powered walkie-talkie system enables secure, multi-kilometer communication without relying on internet infrastructure.

### Project Overview

This embedded systems project creates a versatile communication device where each unit can function as a sender, receiver, or relay node. The system is designed for portability, security, and flexibility, making it ideal for radio enthusiasts, emergency preparedness, or anyone interested in off-grid communication.

### Key Features

**Long-Range Communication**
- LoRa-based radio transmission with multi-kilometer range
- No internet or cellular network required
- Operates in license-free ISM bands

**Security & Privacy**
- AES encryption for secure message transmission
- Private point-to-point communication
- Protected relay message forwarding

**Flexible Operation**
- Multi-role support: sender, receiver, or relay
- Multi-channel support for parallel communication sessions
- Device discovery to scan for nearby nodes
- Customizable device names for easy identification

**Portability**
- Battery-powered operation for off-grid use
- Compact and portable design
- Long battery life for extended field use

**Modern Connectivity**
- BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) support for mobile device integration
- Companion mobile app for enhanced user experience
- Remote control and monitoring capabilities

### Technical Implementation

The project is built on ESP32 microcontrollers, leveraging their WiFi, Bluetooth, and low-power capabilities combined with LoRa radio modules. The system handles Morse code encoding/decoding, encryption, and multi-hop relay functionality.
