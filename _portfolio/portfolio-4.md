## Unity King Derby Game on Solana

A proof-of-concept mobile game demonstrating blockchain integration in Unity, specifically showcasing Solana wallet connectivity and transaction capabilities. This arcade-style horse racing game serves as a practical example of implementing blockchain technology in mobile gaming applications.

### Project Overview

King Derby is inspired by the classic 1981 arcade game by Tazmi, reimagined as a modern mobile game with blockchain integration. Players predict which two horses will finish first and second in a 15-horse race. The game was developed as a single-scene Unity application to demonstrate the feasibility and implementation patterns of Solana blockchain integration in mobile games.

### Blockchain Integration

**Solana Implementation**
- Native Solana wallet integration for mobile devices
- Blockchain transaction handling within Unity
- Demonstration of crypto wallet connectivity patterns
- Foundation for NFT and token-based game mechanics

**What is Solana?**
Solana is an open-source, high-performance, permissionless blockchain platform known for its exceptional speed and low transaction costs. The Solana Foundation, based in Geneva, Switzerland, maintains this innovative blockchain project that enables scalable decentralized applications.

### Platform Availability

The game is published on both major mobile platforms:
- **Android**: Available on Google Play Store
- **iOS**: Available on Apple App Store

### Development Challenges

**Content Rating Navigation**
The development process presented interesting regulatory challenges. Despite being completely free and using no real money, the horse racing theme required careful content rating considerations:
- Classified as "simulated gambling" on mobile platforms
- Required detailed content rating configuration for Android approval
- iOS publication restrictions under personal developer accounts
- Valuable learning experience in mobile app store compliance

### Technical Implementation

**Game Architecture**
- Single-scene Unity game for streamlined development
- Clean separation between game logic and blockchain integration
- Mobile-optimized performance
- Cross-platform codebase for iOS and Android

**Key Features**
- 15-horse racing simulation
- Prediction-based gameplay mechanics
- Solana wallet connectivity
- Blockchain transaction processing
- Mobile-friendly user interface

### Learning Outcomes

This project provided valuable insights into:
- Integrating blockchain technology with Unity game engine
- Mobile app store compliance and content rating requirements
- Cross-platform mobile game deployment
- Balancing game simplicity with technical demonstration goals
- Real-world blockchain application development

### Future Applications

This proof-of-concept demonstrates patterns applicable to:
- NFT-based gaming assets
- Play-to-earn game mechanics
- Decentralized gaming economies
- Blockchain-verified game achievements
- Cross-game asset portability

### Technical Significance

While intentionally kept simple as a POC, this project successfully demonstrates that blockchain integration in mobile games is not only feasible but can be implemented cleanly without compromising user experience. The single-scene architecture proves that even minimal implementations can effectively showcase blockchain capabilities, providing a foundation for more complex decentralized gaming applications.

The project stands as a practical reference for developers looking to integrate Solana or other blockchain technologies into Unity-based mobile games, complete with working examples of wallet connectivity, transaction handling, and cross-platform deployment strategies.
